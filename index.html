          <h3>ATB Project</h3>
          <!--<img src=""></img>-->
          <p>The purpose of this project is to create a short game that uses the Active Time Battle system from Final Fantasy XIII. I loved the combat in that game so I would like to recreate it as an asset on the Unity3D platform.</p>

        <h3>Smart Block</h3>
          <a href="./Josh%2520Website%2520Projects/SmartBlock.zip">Click here to download a Zip folder.</a>
          <p>My favorite project of all so far. This is my game Smart Block which is an endless runner where the goal is to not go too far up into the air. There are obstacles that will try to get to you, but can you fare against them? And can you get the highest score between your friends? Everything in this game was created by hand, including the music. I have a reflection of how I felt after the project was finished.</p>

        <h3>STEM Project</h3>
      <a href>Click here to download a Zip folder</a>
      <p>This was a project where we'd pick a place that can show change over time and implement our classmates into it. I chose the college classroom because I feel that we all changed together and I included helpful tips from each student and teacher in that classroom.</p>
      
      <h3>Lucifer's Revenge</h3>
      <p>This was a project to create a game back in my senior year of high school. I programmed the UI, Animation transitions, Gameplay manager, and enemy logic.</p>
